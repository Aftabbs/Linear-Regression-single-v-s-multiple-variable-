# Linear-Regression-single-v-s-multiple-variable-
Linear Regression of Single vs Multiple Variables
Introduction
This project aims to compare the accuracy of linear regression models with single and multiple variables. The dataset used in this project is the Housing dataset which contains 4600 samples and 18 features. The models are implemented and compared using Jupyter Notebook.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Sklearn


Open the project in Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

jupyter notebook Linear-Regression.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to see the comparison of the linear regression models with single and multiple variables.

Conclusion
The results of the models show that using multiple variables in linear regression can improve the accuracy of the prediction compared to using a single variable. 
This project provides a practical example of how linear regression can be implemented using Jupyter Notebook and how the accuracy of the models can be compared.
